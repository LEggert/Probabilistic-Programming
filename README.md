# Probabilistic-Programming
Collection of small prototype implementations

In the course of my part-time master studies in data science I have to write a seminar paper. I have decided to work on the topic of "probabilisitc programming for data mining". I have started this account to have a central location to manage the probabilistic programming examples that I implement as part of the seminar paper.
